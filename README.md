![Theme Juice CLI](demo.gif)

_This project is currently under active development and will not be completely 'stable' per-say until we hit `1.0`. Everything here is subject to change without notice. (We will of course semantically version all of our releases, with the minor version being incremented with new features/breaking changes.) Feel free to contribute to the development with new features, ideas or bug fixes._

_The master branch contains features currently in development, so don't expect it to work at all times. Grab the newest RubyGem instead of building directly from master._

## What is it?
Theme Juice (`tj`) is a command line utility for modern WordPress development. It allows you to scaffold out a Vagrant development environment in seconds (using an Apache fork of [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) called [VVV-Apache](https://github.com/ericmann/vvv-apache.git) as the VM), and generate/manage an unlimited number of development projects. It also helps you manage dependencies and build tools, and can even handle your deployments.

## Requirements
**`tj` requires [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to be able to create virtual machines for local development. Please download and install both of these before getting started.**

I recommend one of the latest versions of Ruby MRI (2.2, 2.1, 2.0). `tj` requires at least MRI 1.9.3. For the full report, check out the [Travis CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/ezekg/theme-juice-cli), where I test against an array of Ruby interpreters.

I also recommend you set up [SSH-keys for GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/). Internally, `tj` uses `git clone` with SSH URLs, [so things might break if you don't have your keys set up properly](#help-it-wont-let-me-git-clone-anything).

## Installation
```
gem install theme-juice
```

## Getting Started

_If you're going to be using [our starter theme](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-starter), then I recommend checking out [it's dependencies](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-starter#development-dependencies) before running your first `create`. That way, the build step doesn't fail._

#### Create a new project
This will lead you through a series of prompts to set up required project information, such as name, location, theme, database info, etc. Using the specified information, it will run the installation process and set up a local development environment, if one hasn't already been set up. It will sync your local project location with the project
location within the VM, so you can run this from anywhere on your local system.

```
tj create
```

##### What happens on your first `create`?
`tj` will clone the selected VM to your `vm-path` (default path is `~/vagrant/`); after that finishes up, it will create all of the necessary project files, such as:
* `Customfile` containing DNS and synced folder settings
* `init-custom.sql` containing database setup
* `project.conf` containing server settings
* `wp-cli.local.yml` containing VM paths

Once those things are done, `tj` will run the starter theme's installation (via the `Juicefile`, if present), and then finally provision the VM to put the new configuration into effect. If you've never used Vagrant before, the first provision might take awhile. After that's done, you should be able to access your new project at the specified url.

#### Set up an existing project
This sets up an existing local project within the development environment. You will go through a series of prompts to create the necessary files. This command is essentially an alias for `tj create --bare`.

```
tj setup
```

#### Removing a project
This will remove a project from your development environment. This will only remove files that were generated by `tj` i.e. the database setup, DNS setup, and other project configuration files.

It will not touch your local folders that were synced to the VM.

```
tj delete
```

#### Deploying a project
This will deploy a project to the passed `<stage>` using [Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/). Head over to the [docs](http://themejuice.it/deploy) to get started with your first deployment.

```
tj deploy <stage>
```

#### Want more?
Want to check out all of the various flags and features `tj` offers? Just ask `tj` for help, and you'll be greeted with a nice `man` page full of information about how to use just about everything.

```
tj help
```

Or, you can also check out [themejuice.it](http://themejuice.it) for a pretty website chock-full of the same documentation provided by `tj help`.

#### Is Windows supported?
Yes! But, since Windows doesn't support UTF-8 characters inside of the terminal, and is picky about ASCII colors, you'll probably have to run `tj` with a couple flags.

Something that has worked for me on one of my Windows machines is to run all commands through [git-scm](http://git-scm.com/downloads) with the `--boring --no-landrush` flags. This will disable all unicode characters and colors from being output, and will also disable [Landrush](https://github.com/phinze/landrush), which isn't fully supported on Windows.

To set these globally via the `ENV`, set the following environment variables or run the commands below in your terminal:

```bash
export TJ_BORING=true
export TJ_NO_LANDRUSH=true
```

In addition to that, `tj` uses the [OS gem](https://github.com/rdp/os) to sniff out your OS and it'll adjust a few things accordingly to make sure that nothing breaks.

_I don't regularly develop on Windows, so if you encounter any bugs, please let me know through a **well-documented** issue and I'll try my best to get it resolved._

#### Can I use the original VVV instead of VVV-Apache?
Definitely. If you want to use `tj` with Nginx and the [original VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV), it's as simple as running `tj` with a few flags:

```bash
tj new --vm-box git@github.com:Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV.git --nginx
```

To use these permanently, set the appropriate `ENV` variables through your `.bashrc` or similar, i.e. `export TJ_VM_BOX=git@github.com:Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV.git` and `export TJ_NGINX=true`.

_Note: Before running this, you might want to either choose a new `vm-path`, or destroy any existing VMs inside of your `~/vagrant` directory. If `tj` detects that a VM already installed, it will skip installing the new box._

#### So, does that mean I can use any Vagrant box?
Yes and no; in order for `tj` to properly create a project, the Vagrant box needs to follow the same directory structure as VVV, and include a `Customfile`. Here is the required structure that `tj` needs in order to be able to create new projects:

```
├── config/
|  |
|  ├── {apache,nginx}-config/
|  |  |
|  |  ├── site-1.conf
|  |  ├── site-2.conf
|  |  ..
|  ├── database/
|  |  |
|  |  ├── init-custom.sql
|  |  ..
|  ..
├── www/
|  |
|  ├── site-1/
|  |  |
|  |  ├── index.php
|  |  ..
|  ├── site-2/
|  |  |
|  |  ├── index.php
|  |  ..
|  ..
├── Customfile
...
```

#### What is a `Customfile`?
[It's a file that contains custom rules to add into the main `Vagrantfile`, without actually having to modify it](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/blob/develop/Vagrantfile#L208-L218). This allows us to easily modify the Vagrant box without causing merge conflicts if you were to update the VM source via `git pull`.

#### What is a `Juicefile`?
A YAML configuration file (`Juicefile`) can be used to store commonly-used build scripts. Each command block sequence can be mapped to an individual project's build tool, allowing a streamlined set of commands to be used across multiple projects that utilize different tools. In the near-future, this will also house your deployment configuration.

Below is the config that comes baked into [our starter theme](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-starter):

```yml
#
# Manage command aliases for the current application
#
commands:

  # Run application install scripts
  install:
    - composer install
    - bundle install
    - npm install
    - bower install
    - grunt build

  # Manage build tools
  watch:
    - grunt %args%

  # Manage front-end dependencies
  assets:
    - bower %args%

  # Manage back-end dependencies
  vendor:
    - composer %args%

  # Manage WP installation
  wp:
    - wp ssh --host=vagrant %args%

  # Create a backup of the current database with a nice timestamp
  backup:
    - mkdir -p backup
    - wp ssh --host=vagrant db export backup/$(date +'%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S').sql

  # Package up entire application into a gzipped tar file
  dist:
    - tar -zcvf dist.tar.gz .
```

Each command sequence is run within a single execution, with all `%args%`/`%argN%` being replaced by the passed command. Here's a few example scenarios:
```bash
# Will contain all arguments stitched together by a space
cmd1 %args%
# Will contain each argument mapped to its respective index
cmd2 '%arg1% %arg2% %arg3%'
# Will only map argument 4, while ignoring 1-3
cmd3 "%arg4%"
```

You can specify an unlimited number of commands with an unlimited number of arguments; however, you should be careful with how this is used. Don't go including `sudo rm -rf %arg1%` in a command, while passing `/` as an argument. Keep it simple. These are meant to make your life easier by helping you manage build tools, not to do fancy scripting.

#### Does `tj` handle deployments?
As of `0.11`, yes! Check out the [documentation](http://themejuice.it/deploy) to get started.

#### Does `tj` support subdomain multi-sites?
If you're able to use [Landrush](https://github.com/phinze/landrush) for your DNS, then yes. All subdomains will resolve to their parent domain. Landrush comes pre-installed when you create your first project with `tj`. Having said that, unfortunately, if you're on Windows you'll probably have to manually add the subdomains due to Landrush not being fully supported. If you have the Windows chops, head over there and contribute to Landrush by squashing that bug. I'm sure he would appreciate it!

#### Can I access a project from another device (i.e. mobile)?
Yes! Every project created with `tj` will automatically be set up to support using [xip.io](http://xip.io/). If you're using OSX, then everything should work out of the box. If you're not using OSX, then you'll need to point port `80` on your host machine to `8080`; Vagrant cannot do this by default for security reasons.

Once everything is good to go, you can access a project from another device on the same network by going to `<project-name>.<your-hosts-ip-address>.xip.io` e.g. `themejuice.192.168.1.1.xip.io`.

_If you're familiar with forwarding host ports on operating systems other than OSX, check out [this file](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-cli/blob/master/lib/theme-juice/tasks/forward_ports.rb#L34-L51) and make a pull request so that everybody else can benefit from your smarts._

#### Help! It won't let me `git clone` anything!
You most likely don't have [SSH-keys for GitHub set up correctly (if even at all)](https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey/). Either set that up, or manually run `tj` with the appropriate flags corresponding to the problem-repository, swapping out `git@github.com:` for `https://github.com/`:

```
tj create --theme https://github.com/theme/repository.git --vm-box https://github.com/vm-box/repository.git
```

#### Can I add my starter theme, ________?
Yes! Just update the `THEMES` constant inside [commands/create.rb](https://github.com/ezekg/theme-juice-cli/blob/master/lib/theme-juice/commands/create.rb#L7-L12) and make a pull request. I'll verify that the theme includes a `Juicefile` (not required, but preferred to automate build steps), and that everything looks solid. Until then (or if your theme is private), just run `tj create --theme https://your.repo/link/goes.here` to clone your theme.
